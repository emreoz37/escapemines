## Escape Mines

A turtle must walk through a minefield. Write a program (console application) that will read the initial
game settings and one or more sequences of moves. For each move sequence, the program will output
whether the sequence leads to the success or failure of the little turtle.
The program should also handle the scenarios where the turtle doesn’t reach the exit point or doesn’t
hit a mine.
